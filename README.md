# React Quiz App

# Demo Project
### https://quiz-app-react-jasserba.vercel.app/

# Prerequisites

1. [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are installed. Here are the versions I'll be using while making this tutorial:

    ```shell
    $ node --version
    v16.13.2

    $ npm --version
    8.1.2
    ```
    > Installing npm adds two commands to the system—`npm` and `npx`—both of which I'll be using while making this tutorial.

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed. Here's the version I'll be using while making this tutorial:

    ```shell
    $ git --version
    git version 2.29.1.windows.1
    ```
